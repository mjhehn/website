                        Built as a project for fun in mid 2014, this was my first crack at trying to build a simple game with direct feedback from friends and others on the web in how to build out the systems.
                        It was not overly complex, but was my first try at really making a little RPG that had equipment (including a horrendous armor durability mechanic). 
                        <br><br>In most regards, this project was meant to be a testing ground for different mechanics that I at that time intended to then use in a slightly broader game.
                        <br><br>The broader game was intended to use fictionalized versions of the major personalities of the community I was getting feedback from. 
                        Said game really never came to be, and is still just a bunch of scraps of code buried in some directories.
                        <br><br>Even worse, I seem to have lost the source for this one and only really still have the executable and have not spent the time to reverse engineer it.
