                        Built as a project for fun in mid 2014, this was my first crack at trying to build a simple game with direct feedback from friends and others on the web in how to build out the systems.
                        <br>It was not overly complex, but was my first try at really making a little RPG that had equipment (including a horrendous armor durability mechanic). 
                        <br>In most regards, it was meant to be a testing ground for different mechanics that I at that time intended to then use in a slightly broader game.
                        <br>This broader game was intended to use fictionalized versions of the major personalities of the community I was getting feedback from. 
                        <br>Said game really name came to be, and is still just a bunch of scraps of code buried in some directories.
                        <br><br>Even worse, I seem to have lost the source for this one and only really still have an .exe and dependencies.
