                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Built as the course project for a contextual design class in a six-person group. This design was built for a set of users which act as a commerical 3D printing space while also renting use of their machines for a period. 
                    <br><br>Major focuses of the project were on-site interviews, identification and consolidation of recognized breakdowns in existing practices and technology,and the eventual development of a design the team thinks would have minimal conflict with the existing culture and workflows of the 3D printing group while improving on or fixing the major breakdowns.
