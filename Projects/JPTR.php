                        Project JPTR is easily project here that has been worked on longest, with practically the least to show for it.
                        <br><br>In its original incarnation in August of 2014, Project JPTR was intended as a fun writing exercise among myself and a few friends as effectively a piece of fanfiction set in the universe
                        of <a href="https://roosterteeth.com/">Rooster Teeth's</a> RWBY series.

                        <br><br>It was worked on off and on for the next few months, with a basic story outline completed and a series of characters put together by the various writers. We also worked on
                        developing some basic artwork for the characters, and tried to research what little at that time had been said about the series to try and keep our decisions in keeping with
                        guidelines given by the series creator, Monty Oum.

                        <br><br>Monty was creatively a large influence on the group of us, and he regularly extolled people to express themselves creatively and to work tirelessly toward what they wanted to achieve.

                        <br><br>When he passed in February of 2015, the focus of Project JPTR was shifted. In the wake of his passing, his wife noted that the best tribute to Monty would be for everyone who enjoyed his work
                        to go out and make something themselves. So Project JPTR became an story-centric JRPG-like game in design.

                        <br><br>It went practically nowhere after that, with dozens of false starts as the team struggled to actually coordinate in order to further the project.

                        <br><br>In 2016, the team was pared down from 4-5 to two, and more focused discussion and development began after effectively scrapping the previous work. It has continued to be slow, but it is progressing steadily, even now.
