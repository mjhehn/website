[[File:Game1.png|frame|The opening for Wayne's original final project.]] 
This page is the home of half baked text based adventure game designed and coded by Wayne in the C++ programming language. This page is for Wayne to try and get ideas and bug testing for these silly little games.


==In the Shadow of Immortals==
[[File:Magery.png|frame|A sneak peek of what's to come.]]This game will be roughly based upon the characters of the old Forum Fight (Now Eleven Realms). Planned elements of the game include, but are not limited to:
*Three different factions/special elements (Order, Chaos, and Balance.. may get better names) with different endings for the game and different allies/equipment.
*Diverse NPC combat styles.
*Turn-by-turn combat
**Current planned elements:
***Magic, Melee, and Ranged combat usable by any character.(but tied to the weapon)
***Learnable skills
***Armor/Equipment and durability/breaking mechanic
***Elemental weapon/spell damage modifers
***Fully Customizable equipment lists. (Build your own equipment by mixing and matching various effects.)
***Save feature
***Standard Stats array.(Strength, Dexterity, etc.)
***Distance element of play. (Melee has to be close up for most weapons, magic at some ranges, and ranged at others. Bosses will require varying tactics hopefully. repositioning will require one turn.)
*Story driven "boss" fights.
*Simple puzzles

==Legacy Version==
This segment of the page holds information on the old version of 'NCTG', which has since become an abandoned project in its original state.



'''Legacy NCTG: 0.1 <- Core 'engine' stable, [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3bmid8jMEeOdGF2ejlZVDhubVk/edit?usp=sharing combat demo] released. (Should not require anything additional to run. Let me know if that proves to not be the case.)'''


===<span style="font-size:18px;">Mechanics</span>===
Created and semi-Functional in NCTG v0.1Â 
*Basic commands for movement, picking up objects, examining, etc.
*Magic/Combat special abilities. (Listed below are what spells are in-game at this time. all spells/attacks have a basic and advanced tier which must either be bought or found.)
**Healing spells
***Basic heals 25 hp, Advanced heals 50hp.
**Fireball spells
***Basic: Normal damage, applies a 3 turn DoT. Advanced: enhanced damage, applies 5 turn DoT.
**Shield Spells
***Basic: Reduces next enemy attack's damage by half. Advanced: Negates next enemy attack.
**IceBreath Spells
***Basic: Reduced base damage, applies enemy damage debuff for 3 turns. Advanced: base damage and applies enemy damage debuff for 5 turns.
**Melee Attacks
***Basic: Base damage, regenerates more mana. Advanced: enhanced damage, regenerates less mana.
*HP/MP system. (100 HP/MP base. Can be healed/generated over this limit as of the current build.)
*Equipment. (armor/weapons)
**Current Equipment in-game:
***Three tiers of different weapon types.
****Dagger/knife weapon type- small damage range.
****Rapier weapon type- medium damage range
****Sword- large damage range
***Scyfle easter egg weapon.
***Various armors and tiers.
****Armor function as additional debuffs to enemy damage, reducing the drop in the player's HP. Each armor has a durability which goes down every turn. If the durability drops to zero during a battle, the enemy damage reduction is removed.
*Shop system
**Simple shop interface. (No polish, but it works.) Equip/wear function added in conjunction with this and the equipment add.
*Randomly Generated Monsters
**Monsters are now generated based on a player "level", increasing both their HP and their damage as one progresses in the game. Bosses will be given their own special attacks similar to the players. (Once bosses are created of course.)

This was Wayne's final project this year, and is pseudo-pokemon ripoff.

Anyone interested in creating their own additional "characters" to use can talk to me and I'll walk through it with you.

As usual, if things break, let me know. The file dependency should be in the NCTG folder, so link to that to get that file if you don't want to install the dependencies.
